                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Call of Duty: Mobile is a free-to-play shooter game developed by
                    TiMi Studio Group and published by Activision for Android and iOS. It was released on October 1,
                    2019, where it was one of the largest mobile game launches in history, generating over US$480
                    million with 270 million downloads within a year. Call of Duty: Mobile was published in other
                    regions by Garena, Tencent Games, VNG Games and TiMi Studio Group.
                    Gameplay
                    Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches in multiplayer mode. It has two types of
                    in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD Points", which
                    are bought with real-world money. It is possible to play the full game without paying, though some
                    exclusive character and weapon skins can only be bought with COD Points.

                    knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
                    society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling
                    passed knowledge,
                    values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
                    beyond skills that could
                    be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the
                    time of the Middle
                    Kingdom.</p>

                        they are a player's first impression of a game, and an overly tedious tutorial or one that does
                        not allow for player freedom can negatively affect their view of a game. However, the lack of a
                        tutorial can also harm a game by causing the player to become frustrated, since they cannot
                        figure out essential game mechanics.
